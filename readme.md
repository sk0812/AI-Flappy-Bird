# AI Flappy Bird

This project consists of two main components: the creation of the Flappy Bird game from scratch and the implementation of an AI agent trained using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm to play and beat the game.

## Project Overview

1. **Flappy Bird Game**: A classic 2D side-scrolling game where the player controls a bird, navigating through pipes by tapping the screen to make the bird "flap" and avoid obstacles. The game is built from scratch using Python and the Pygame library.

2. **AI Training with NEAT**: An AI agent is trained using the NEAT algorithm, which evolves neural networks to improve performance over generations. The agent learns to navigate through the pipes and achieve a high score by flapping at the right moments.

## Features

- **Custom Game Mechanics**: Fully functional Flappy Bird game with customizable parameters such as gravity, flap height, and game speed.
- **Real-Time Graphics**: Engaging graphics and animations to provide a smooth gaming experience.
- **NEAT Integration**: Implementation of the NEAT algorithm to train AI agents, evolving neural networks that learn to play the game effectively.
- **Performance Visualization**: Real-time monitoring of the AI's performance as it plays the game, including scoring and survival time.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for development.
- **Pygame**: A library for creating video games, providing functionality for graphics, sound, and input handling.
- **NEAT-Python**: A Python implementation of the NEAT algorithm for training neural networks.
